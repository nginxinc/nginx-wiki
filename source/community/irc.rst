IRC Channel
===========

In an effort to keep our community clean and organized, we have created a set
of guidelines for how we expect users and operators to behave on IRC.

.. _community-irc-coc:

Code of Conduct
---------------

NGINX is growing rapidly both as software and as a community. As a growing community, we need to be able
to work together effectively, and these guidelines are intended to help us do that.

In the free software world, we collaborate on a volunteer basis to build
software for everyone's benefit. We improve on the work of others, which we
have been given freely, and then share our improvements on the same basis. We
additionally help others learn about the software and help them use it
effectively. That collaboration depends on good relationships between developers
and users. Our team has agreed on the following code of conduct to help define
the ways that we expect all users and operators to adhere to.

* *Be Considerate*: Everyone is around to either help or be helped. We're all
  around to learn. All the work we do affects someone else and we need to
  consider this when we make any changes.
* *Be Respectful*: Members of the NGINX community treat one another with respect.
  Everyone can make valuable contributions to NGINX. We may not always agree,
  but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and/or poor manners. We might
  all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
  frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a
  community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
  one. We expect members of the NGINX community to be respectful when dealing
  with all others. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be
  perfect. Asking questions is how we learn. Those who are asked questions
  should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must
  be taken to do so in an appropriate forum.
* *Be Constructive*: Avoid flame wars, trolling, personal attacks, and
  repetitive arguments.
* *Be Family Friendly*: We are not sailors and have no need to act like it.
  Topics such as sex, drugs, violence, etc. as well as swearing will not be
  permitted.
* *Stay On Topic*: The NGINX IRC channel is meant to be a means of support.
  When other users are asking for support, they should not have to read your
  random chatter about what you had for dinner. Chatter like this is unwelcome
  when other users are seeking support. If the conversation becomes
  excessive or interferes with users seeking support, it needs to move
  to #nginx-social or another off-topic channel.
* *Don't Spam*: Things such as frequent nick changes, away nicks, pasting
  multiple lines of text, displaying away messages, repeating questions
  frequently, spamming the enter key, etc. are all forms of spam and are
  unwelcome. There is little tolerance for spam in the NGINX community. Just
  don't do it.
* *Use Common Sense*: Common sense is in short supply these days, but it's
  still expected that our users have and use it. As a general rule, treat
  everyone the way you want to be treated. 

This list is not inclusive. We will uphold the `Libera Chat Network Guidelines`_
as well as the `Libera Chat Channel Guidelines`_. Any and all users should both
follow and enforce these guidelines where they see fit.

Appeals Process
---------------

Nobody is perfect, not even the operators. In case of problems between users or
between users and operators, the other operators can mediate. If you think you
have been treated wrongly, please follow these steps to reach a resolution.

* Be calm, no caps or swearing. Seriously. If you feel the need to shout at
  someone or to swear, please take 5 minutes out before doing anything. Nobody
  will feel like helping you if you are swearing, shouting, or otherwise
  behaving in a disruptive manner.
* PM the operator who took action; mistakes can be made by both sides. Short,
  calm, and polite conversations can quickly solve problems and clear the air.
* If the previous step has failed then feel free to join #nginx-master. Another
  operator might be able to resolve the problem. 

Before any of this, make sure you have read the :ref:`community-irc-coc`. It
may also be helpful to take a look at our :ref:`community-irc_ops` document.
