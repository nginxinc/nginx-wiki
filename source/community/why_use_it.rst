   :description: Testimonials from people using NGINX in the real world, under real load, serving real applications and websites.

Why Use NGINX?
==============

A couple benchmarks have shown NGINX to edge out
other lightweight web servers and proxies, and to stomp out the not-so
lightweight ones.

Some people say those benchmarks weren't valid because the competition
wasn't tuned this way or that, etc. I tend to agree that benchmarks only
tell part of the story and that there's little you can do to truly
remove bias from them anyway. (Has anyone ever seen a benchmark that
everyone agreed was fair? Me neither.)

Anyway, instead of links to benchmarks for people to argue over
(you can use Google to find them yourself if you like), what
follows is quotes from people using NGINX in the real world, under real
load, serving real applications and websites.

Please feel free to add your own testimonial, but see the
`Notes <why_use_it.notes_>`_ at the bottom of this page before you do.

------
Several of the companies we invested in were able to solve significant scaling
issues by switching their web platforms to NGINX. NGINX transparently and
effectively enables the growth of the largest sites on the Internet today.

-- Thomas Gieselmann, BV Capital


My advice to anyone running a web site today who is hitting performance
constraints is to investigate whether they can use NGINX. CloudFlare has
been able to scale over the last year to handle more than 15 billion monthly
page views with a relatively modest infrastructure, in large part because
of the scalability of NGINX. Our experience shows that switching to NGINX
enables full utilization of the modern operating system and existing hardware
resources.

-- Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of CloudFlare


Both servers [Apache and NGINX] are capable of serving a huge number of requests per
second, but Apache's performance start decreasing as you add more concurrent
connections whereas NGINX's performance almost doesn't drop!
But here comes the best bit: because NGINX is event-based it doesn't need to
spawn new processes or threads for each request, so its memory usage is very low.
Throughout my benchmark it just sat at 2.5MB of memory while Apache was using a
lot more.

I ran a simple test against NGINX v0.5.22 and Apache v2.2.8 using ab (Apache's
benchmarking tool). During the tests, I monitored the system with vmstat and top.
The results indicate that NGINX outperforms Apache when serving static content.
Both servers performed best with a concurrency of 100. Apache used four worker
processes (threaded mode), 30% CPU and 17MB of memory to serve 6,500 requests per
second. NGINX used one worker, 15% CPU and 1MB of memory to serve 11,500 requests
per second.

Apache is like Microsoft Word, it has a million options but you only need
six. NGINX does those six things, and it does five of them 50 times faster
than Apache.

I currently have NGINX doing reverse proxy of over tens of millions of
HTTP requests per day (that's a few hundred per second) on a single server.
At peak load it uses about 15MB RAM and 10% CPU on my particular configuration
(FreeBSD 6).
Under the same kind of load, Apache falls over (after using 1000 or so
processes and god knows how much RAM), Pound falls over (too many threads,
and using 400MB+ of RAM for all the thread stacks), and Lighty leaks more
than 20MB per hour (and uses more CPU, but not significantly more).

We are currently using NGINX 0.6.29 with the upstream hash module which
gives us the static hashing we need to proxy to Varnish. We are regularly
serving about 8-9k requests/second and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few NGINX
instances and have plenty of room to grow!

   We were using Pound for load balancing at Justin.tv until today. It was
   consistently using about 20% CPU, and during spikes would use up to 80% CPU.
   Under extremely high load, it would occasionally freak out and break.
   We just switched to NGINX, and load immediately dropped to around 3% CPU.
   Our pages feel a little snappier, although that might be my imagination.
   Not only is the config format easier to understand and better documented,
   but it offers a full web server's complement of functionality. We haven't
   hit any spikes yet, but given the current performance I suspect it will
   cream Pound.

...we are using NGINX as a primary software for free hosting platforms. I have
developed specific modules for banner inserting and stats calculation in NGINX
and now our central server can handle about 150-200Mbit/s of highly fragmented
http-traffic (all files are small).
I think, this is really good result because with any possible tunings of Apache
on the same servers we were not able to handle even 60-80Mbit/s.

A while back, we changed our frontend IMAP/POP proxy from perdition to NGINX...
[and] we’ve now switched over to using NGINX for our frontend web proxy as well...
The net result of all this is that each frontend proxy server currently maintains
over 10,000 simultaneous IMAP, POP, Web & SMTP connections (including many SSL
ones) using only about 10% of the available CPU.

We recently switched over our static content webserver over to NGINX,
easily the most impressive webserver I’ve seen in years. We’re running
it on a machine with 8Gb of memory (along with some other stuff), but
the NGINX process is only using a ridiculously small 1.4Mb. In other words,
it barely registers in any measurable way.

We've replaced our Squid (reverse proxy) + Apache setup with NGINX, and
load average as well as CPU usage have been reduced by half. In addition
to that our benchmarks show that the new setup can handle about two to
three times as many requests per second (RPS) as the old setup.

-- `HowtoForge <https://www.howtoforge.com>`_


We've done some `benchmarks <https://timmehosting.de/benchmarks>`__ for
CMS systems such as Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, TYPO3, etc., and the
result is that NGINX delivers pages up to 50% faster than Apache. At the
same time NGINX can handle up to 177% as many requests per second (RPS)
as Apache.

I just want to say that after migrating to NGINX, we will never use APACHE ever again. 
Its stability, easy scalability and optimum use of resources make of Nginx the best choice 
for sites that require a high performance, such as ours, delivering millions of page views 
to our readers, even with modest hardware infrastructures.

-- `Fernando Salvato, VP Digital Business Development, La Gran Época (Epoch Times) <https://www.lagranepoca.com>`_

After moving our site to NGINX, we are more than satisfied and using it 
from several years. NGINX is capable of serving a huge number of requests as compared 
to Apache! We never look back and this is the end of story. As per our site results,
NGINX is more than 50% faster than Apache.

At `Kinsta <https://kinsta.com>`__, we exclusively use Nginx as part of our 
performance-optimized hosting solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce. 
Every WordPress site is housed in its own isolated container, which has all 
of the software resources required to run it (Nginx, Linux, PHP, MySQL). The 
resources are 100% private and are not shared between any other sites. Nginx 
is very efficient in serving static content on its own. It can cache static 
content without the need to fetch it from the protected, origin server every 
time. Tens of thousands of small and large WordPress sites are powered by Nginx 
at Kinsta. You can read more on why we chose `Nginx over Apache 
<https://kinsta.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache/>`__.

Our business is one of the apparently growing number bailing out on Microsoft's 
IIS servers. The problem is that we need to serve out static content over lots 
of concurrent connections and had never been satisfied with the MS performance. 
Bottom line, we narrowed it down to Apache and NGINX but finally went with the 
latter, to the shock of some, after talking to a few companies that had similar 
use demands. After making the switch, we tested exhaustively and found that our 
content delivery speed almost doubled, which was a good enough result to justify 
the hassle of changing by itself, but also found that overall system memory 
demand decreased almost 5%. We finally fell in love with our server.

Notes
-----

Please feel free to add your own testimonial, but we prefer that it
refer to a *high traffic site* or a site that NGINX somehow provided a
*unique* solution for. Also, if numbers (server utilization, network
throughput, simultaneous connections, etc) and/or an actual link to the
site being discussed can be provided it makes it much more relevant for
people curious about NGINX.
