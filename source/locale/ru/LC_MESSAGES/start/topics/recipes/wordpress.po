"`Nginx <http://nginx.org>`_ works perfectly well with a wide variety of "
"applications, and `WordPress <https://wordpress.org>`_ is certainly one of "
"them.  Nginx's configuration language is very powerful and straightforward "
"if one is familiar with it, but often people coming from other servers are "
"not sure how things work in Nginx and just copy and paste whatever they see "
"from a blog that seems to fill their needs.  Everyone, especially people new"
" to Nginx, should check out the `nginx.org documentation "
"<http://nginx.org/en/docs/>`_ for an overview of how things work and should "
"be done in Nginx."
