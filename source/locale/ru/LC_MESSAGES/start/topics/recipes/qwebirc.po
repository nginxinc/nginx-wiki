"`Qwebirc <https://qwebirc.org/>`_ is a fast, easy to use, free and open "
"source IRC client designed by and originally just for the `QuakeNet IRC "
"network <https://www.quakenet.org/>`_. Released in 2009, it's a `python "
"<https://www.python.org>`_ written web-based IRC client. It also has a fork,"
" `iris <http://www.atheme.net/iris.html>`_, developed by the `Atheme "
"<http://www.atheme.net/>`_ IRC services team, and provides better "
"integration with Atheme's IRC services. Qwebirc uses its own embedded "
"webserver utilizing non-blocking multiplexing, and can cope with thousands "
"of users easily. Because of this, there are two methods which can be used to"
" direct clients to a qwebirc instance via `nginx <https://nginx.org>`_: "
"redirection, or reverse proxy."
