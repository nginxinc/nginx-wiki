Pitfalls and Common Mistakes
============================

New and old users alike can run into a pitfall. Below we outline issues that we
see frequently as well as explain how to resolve those issues. In the #nginx IRC
channel on Freenode, we see these issues frequently.

This Guide Says
---------------

The most frequent issue we see happens when someone attempts to just copy and
paste a configuration snippet from some other guide. Not all guides out there
are wrong, but a scary number of them are.

These docs were created and reviewed by community members that work
directly with all types of NGINX users. This specific document exists only
because of the volume of common and recurring issues that community members see.

My Issue Isn't Listed
---------------------

You don't see something in here related to your specific issue. Maybe we didn't
point you here because of the exact issue you're experiencing. Don't skim this
page and assume you were sent here for no reason. You were sent here because
something you did wrong is listed here.

When it comes to supporting many users on many issues, community members don't
want to support broken configurations. Fix your configuration before asking for
help. Fix your configuration by reading through this. Don't just skim it.

Chmod 777
---------

NEVER use ``777``. It might be one nifty number, but even in testing it's a sign of
having no clue what you're doing. Look at the permissions in the whole path and
think through what's going on.

To easily display all the permissions on a path, you can use:

.. code-block:: text

    namei -om /path/to/check

Root inside Location Block
--------------------------

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name www.example.com;
        location / {
            root /var/www/nginx-default/;
            # [...]
          }
        location /foo {
            root /var/www/nginx-default/;
            # [...]
        }
        location /bar {
            root /some/other/place;
            # [...]
        }
    }

This works. Putting root inside of a ``location`` block will work and it's perfectly
valid. What's wrong is when you start adding ``location`` blocks. If you add a root
to every location block then a ``location`` block that isn't matched will have no
root. Therefore, it is important that a root directive occur prior to your
``location`` blocks, which can then override this directive if they need to.
Let's look at a good configuration.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name www.example.com;
        root /var/www/nginx-default/;
        location / {
            # [...]
        }
        location /foo {
            # [...]
        }
        location /bar {
            root /some/other/place;
            # [...]
        }
    }

Multiple Index Directives
-------------------------

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    http {
        index index.php index.htm index.html;
        server {
            server_name www.example.com;
            location / {
                index index.php index.htm index.html;
                # [...]
            }
        }
        server {
            server_name example.com;
            location / {
                index index.php index.htm index.html;
                # [...]
            }
            location /foo {
                index index.php;
                # [...]
            }
        }
    }

Why repeat so many lines when not needed? Simply use the ``index`` directive one
time. It only needs to occur in your ``http{}`` block and it will be inherited
below.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    http {
        index index.php index.htm index.html;
        server {
            server_name www.example.com;
            location / {
                # [...]
            }
        }
        server {
            server_name example.com;
            location / {
                # [...]
            }
            location /foo {
                # [...]
            }
        }
    }

Using ``if``
------------

There is a little page about using ``if`` statements. It's called IfIsEvil and you
really should check it out. Let's take a look at a few uses of ``if`` that are bad.

.. seealso:: :doc:`If Is Evil </start/topics/depth/ifisevil>`

Server Name (If)
----------------

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name example.com *.example.com;
            if ($host ~* ^www\.(.+)) {
                set $raw_domain $1;
                rewrite ^/(.*)$ $raw_domain/$1 permanent;
            }
            # [...]
        }
    }

There are actually three problems here. The first being the ``if``. That's what we
care about now. Why is this bad? Did you read If is Evil? When NGINX receives a
request - no matter what is the subdomain being requested, be it www.example.com or 
just the plain example.com - this ``if`` directive is **always** evaluated. Since
you're requesting NGINX to check for the Host header for **every request**,
it's extremely inefficient. You should avoid it. Instead use two ``server``
directives like the example below.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name www.example.com;
        return 301 $scheme://example.com$request_uri;
    }
    server {
        server_name example.com;
        # [...]
    }

Besides making the configuration file easier to read. This approach decreases
NGINX processing requirements. We got rid of the spurious ``if``. We're also using
``$scheme`` which doesn't hardcode the URI scheme you're using, be it http or
https.

Check (If) File Exists
----------------------

Using ``if`` to ensure a file exists is horrible. It's mean. If you have any recent
version of NGINX you should look at ``try_files`` which just made life much easier.

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        root /var/www/example.com;
        location / {
            if (!-f $request_filename) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        root /var/www/example.com;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
    }

What we changed is that we try to see if ``$uri`` exists without requiring ``if``.
Using ``try_files`` means that you can test a sequence. If ``$uri`` doesn't exist, try
``$uri/``, if that doesn't exist try a fallback location.

In this case, if the ``$uri`` file exists, serve it. If not, check if that directory
exists. If not, then proceed to serve ``index.html`` which you make sure exists.
It's loaded â€“ but oh-so-simple! This is another instance where you can completely
eliminate If.

Front Controller Pattern Web Apps
---------------------------------

"Front Controller Pattern" designs are popular and are used on the many of the most
popular PHP software packages; But a lot of examples are more complex than they need
to be. For Drupal, Joomla, etc., just use this:

.. code-block:: nginx

    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;

Note - the parameter names are different based on the package you're using. For
example:

* "q" is the parameter used by Drupal, Joomla, WordPress
* "page" is used by CMS Made Simple

Some software don't even need the query string and can read from REQUEST_URI.
For example, WordPress supports this:

.. code-block:: nginx

    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;

If you don't care about checking for the existence of directories, you can skip
it by removing ``$uri/``.

Of course, your mileage may vary and you may require something more complex based on
your needs, but for basic sites, these will work perfectly. You should always
start simple and build from there.

Passing Uncontrolled Requests to PHP
------------------------------------

Many example NGINX configurations for PHP on the web advocate passing every URI
ending in ``.php`` to the PHP interpreter. Note that this presents a serious
security issue on most PHP setups as it may allow arbitrary code execution by
third parties.

The problem section usually looks like this:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~* \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass backend;
        # [...]
    }

Here, every request ending in ``.php`` will be passed to the FastCGI backend. The
issue with this is that the default PHP configuration tries to guess which file
you want to execute if the full path does not lead to an actual file on the
filesystem.

For instance, if a request is made for `/forum/avatar/1232.jpg/file.php` which
does not exist but if `/forum/avatar/1232.jpg` does, the PHP interpreter will
process `/forum/avatar/1232.jpg` instead. If this contains embedded PHP code,
this code will be executed accordingly.

Options for avoiding this are:

* Set ``cgi.fix_pathinfo=0`` in ``php.ini``. This causes the PHP interpreter to only
  try the literal path given and to stop processing if the file is not found.
* Ensure that NGINX only passes specific PHP files for execution:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~* (file_a|file_b|file_c)\.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass backend;
        # [...]
    }

* Specifically disable the execution of PHP files in any directory containing
  user uploads:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location /uploaddir {
        location ~ \.php$ {return 403;}
        # [...]
    }

* Use the ``try_files`` directive to filter out the problem condition:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~* \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_pass backend;
        # [...]
    }

* Use a nested location to filter out the problem condition:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~* \.php$ {
        location ~ \..*/.*\.php$ {return 404;}
        fastcgi_pass backend;
        # [...]
    }

FastCGI Path in Script Filename
-------------------------------

So many guides out there like to rely on absolute paths to get to your
information. This is commonly seen in PHP blocks. When you install NGINX from a
repository, you'll usually wind up being able to toss ``include fastcgi_params;``
in your config. This is a file located in your NGINX root directory which is
usually around ``/etc/nginx/``.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    /var/www/yoursite.com/$fastcgi_script_name;

Where is ``$document_root`` set? It's set by the root directive that should be in
your server block. Is your root directive not there? See the first pitfall.

Taxing Rewrites
---------------

Don't feel bad here, it's easy to get confused with regular expressions. In
fact, it's so easy to do that we should make an effort to keep them neat and
clean. Quite simply, don't add cruft.

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    rewrite ^/(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 permanent;

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    rewrite ^ http://example.com$request_uri? permanent;

BETTER:

.. code-block:: nginx

    return 301 http://example.com$request_uri;

Look at the above. Then back here. Then up, and back here. OK. The first rewrite
captures the full URI minus the first slash. By using the built-in variable
``$request_uri`` we can effectively avoid doing any capturing or matching at all.

Rewrite Missing ``http://``
---------------------------

Very simply, rewrites are relative unless you tell NGINX that they're not.
Making a rewrite absolute is simple. Add a scheme.

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    rewrite ^ example.com permanent;

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    rewrite ^ http://example.com permanent;

In the above you will see that all we did was add ``http://`` to the
rewrite. It's simple, easy, and effective.

Proxy Everything
----------------

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name _;
        root /var/www/site;
        location / {
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/phpcgi.socket;
        }
    }

Yucky. In this instance, you pass EVERYTHING to PHP. Why? Apache might do this,
but you don't need to. The try_files directive exists for an amazing reason:
It tries files in a specific order. NGINX can first try to serve the static
content, and if it can't, it moves on. This means PHP doesn't get involved at
all. MUCH faster. Especially if you're serving a 1MB image over PHP a few
thousand times versus serving it directly. Let's take a look at how to do that.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name _;
        root /var/www/site;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ @proxy;
        }
        location @proxy {
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/phpcgi.socket;
        }
    }

Also GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        server_name _;
        root /var/www/site;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
        }
        location ~ \.php$ {
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/phpcgi.socket;
        }
    }

Easy, right? Check if the requested URI exists and can be served by NGINX. If not,
check if it is a directory that can be served. If not, then pass it to your proxy.
Only when NGINX can't serve that requested URI directly, your proxy overhead will
get involved.

Consider how many of your requests are for static content (images, css,
javascript, etc.). That's probably a lot of overhead you just saved.

Use ``$request_filename`` for ``SCRIPT_FILENAME``
-------------------------------------------------

Use ``$request_filename`` instead of ``$document_root$fastcgi_script_name``.

If you use the ``alias`` directive with ``$document_root$fastcgi_script_name``, ``$document_root$fastcgi_script_name`` will return the wrong path.

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

   location /api/ {
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;
        alias /app/www/;
        location ~* "\.php$" {
            try_files      $uri =404;
            fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index  index.php;
            fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    }

Request ``/api/testing.php``:

- ``$document_root$fastcgi_script_name`` == ``/app/www//api/testing.php``
- ``$request_filename`` == ``/app/www/testing.php``

Request ``/api/``:

- ``$document_root$fastcgi_script_name`` == ``/app/www//api/index.php``
- ``$request_filename`` == ``/app/www/index.php``

And if you use ``$request_filename``, you should set index using ``index`` directive, ``fastcgi_index`` will not work.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

   location /api/ {
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;
        alias /app/www/;
        location ~* "\.php$" {
            try_files      $uri =404;
            fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $request_filename;
        }
    }

Config Changes Not Reflected
----------------------------

Browser cache. Your configuration may be perfect but you'll sit there and beat
your head against a cement wall for a month. What's wrong is your browser cache.
When you download something, your browser stores it. It also stores how that
file was served. If you are playing with a ``types{}`` block you'll encounter this.

The fix:

* In Firefox press Ctrl+Shift+Delete, check Cache, click Clear Now. In
  any other browser, just ask your favorite search engine. Do this after every
  change (unless you know it's not needed) and you'll save yourself a lot of
  headaches.
* Use curl.

VirtualBox
----------

If this does not work, and you're running NGINX on a virtual machine in
VirtualBox, it may be sendfile() that is causing the trouble. Simply comment out
the sendfile directive or set it to "off". The directive is most likely found in
your nginx.conf file.:

.. code-block:: nginx

    sendfile off;

Missing (disappearing) HTTP Headers
-----------------------------------

If you do not explicitly set ``underscores_in_headers on;``, NGINX will silently
drop HTTP headers with underscores (which are perfectly valid according to the
HTTP standard). This is done in order to prevent ambiguities when mapping
headers to CGI variables as both dashes and underscores are mapped to
underscores during that process.

Not Using Standard Document Root Locations
------------------------------------------

Some directories in any file system should never be used for hosting data from.
These include ``/`` and ``root``. You should never use these as your
document root.

Doing this leaves you open to a request outside of your expected area returning
private data.

NEVER DO THIS!!! (yes, we have seen this)

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        root /;

        location / {
            try_files /web/$uri $uri @php;
        }

        location @php {
            # [...]
        }
    }

When a request is made for ``/foo``, the request is passed to php because the file
isn't found. This can appear fine, until a request in made for ``/etc/passwd``.
Yup, you just gave us a list of all users on that server. In some cases, the
NGINX server is even set up run workers as root. Yup, we now have your user
list as well as password hashes and how they've been hashed. We now own your
box.

.. _`File System Hierarchy` : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard

The `File System Hierarchy`_ defines where data should exist. You should
definitely read it. The short version is that you want your web content to exist
in either ``/var/www/``, ``/srv``, ``/usr/share/www``.

Using the Default Document Root
-------------------------------

NGINX packages that exist in Ubuntu, Debian, or other operating systems, as an
easy-to-install package will often provide a 'default' configuration file as
an example of configuration methods, and will often include a document root to
hold a basic HTML file.

Most of these packaging systems do not check to see if files are modified or
exist within the default document root, which can result in code loss when the
packages are upgraded. Experienced system administrators know that there is no
expectation of the data inside the default document root to remain untouched
during upgrades.

You should not use the default document root for any site-critical files. There
is no expectation that the default document root will be left untouched by the
system and there is an extremely high possibility that your site-critical data
may be lost upon updates and upgrades to the NGINX packages for your operating
system.

Using a Hostname to Resolve Addresses
-------------------------------------

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    upstream {
        server http://someserver;
    }

    server {
        listen myhostname:80;
        # [...]
    }

You should never use a hostname in a listen directive. While this may work, it
will come with a large number of issues. One such issue being that the hostname
may not resolve at boot time or during a service restart. This can cause NGINX
to be unable to bind to the desired TCP socket which will prevent NGINX from
starting at all.

A safer practice is to know the IP address that needs to be bound to and use
that address instead of the hostname. This prevents NGINX from needing to look
up the address and removes dependencies on external and internal resolvers.

This same issue applies to upstream locations. While it may not always be
possible to avoid using a hostname in an upstream block, it is bad practice and
will require careful considerations to prevent issues.

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    upstream {
        server http://10.48.41.12;
    }

    server {
        listen 127.0.0.16:80;
        # [...]
    }

Using SSLv3 with HTTPS
----------------------

Due to the POODLE vulnerability in SSLv3, it is advised to not use SSLv3 in your
SSL-enabled sites. You can very easily disable SSLv3 with this line and provide
only the TLS protocols instead:

.. code-block:: nginx

    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

Using the ``try_files $uri`` directive with ``alias``
-----------------------------------------------------

The symptoms of this are difficult to diagnose: typically, it will appear that
you've done everything right and yet you get mysterious 404 errors. Why? well,
turning on debug-level error logging reveals that ``try_files`` is appending
``$uri`` onto the path already set with ``alias``. This is due to a bug_ in NGINX,
but don't worryâ€”the workaround is simple! As long as your ``try_files`` line is
something like ``try_files $uri $uri/ =404;``, you can simply delete the ``try_files``
line with no significant adverse effect. Here is an example where you cannot use
``try_files``.

BAD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~^/\~(?<user>[^/]*)/(?<page>.*)$ {
        alias /home/$user/public_html/$page;
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

GOOD:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~^/\~(?<user>[^/]*)/(?<page>.*)$ {
        alias /home/$user/public_html/$page;
    }

The one caveat is that this workaround prevents you from using ``try_files`` to avoid
PATH_INFO attacks. See `Passing Uncontrolled Requests to PHP`_ above for alternative ways
to mitigate these attacks.

Also note that the ``snippets/fastcgi-php.conf`` file shipped by some Linux distributions
may need to be edited to remove a ``try_files`` directive if it's included in a ``location``
block with ``alias``.

.. _bug: https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/97
