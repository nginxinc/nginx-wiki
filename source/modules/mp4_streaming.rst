{{Anchor|installation}}
== Installation ==

Download the tarball as described above and 'tar jx' it.

After extracting, add the following option to your Nginx ./configure command:

<pre>
: --add-module=path/to/mp4_streaming_lite/directory
</pre>

By default, nginx uses -O to compile the source code. You should use

<pre>
: --with-cc-opt='-O3'
</pre>

with configure to retrieve maximum performance.
