NGINX wiki

This is the source repository for the new NGINX wiki. It is written in reStructuredText format as intended to be compiled into HTML using `Sphinx Documentation Generator <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

Compiling
---------

To compile a local copy of the documentation you will need Sphinx installed. It can be installed with Python's pip package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

You can then build the docs with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make dirhtml

The HTML output is stored in the ``build/dirhtml`` directory. You can view this any way you desire, a very easy way to do it is to use NGINX. The build system can execute NGINX using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make serve

Or if you have NGINX in a non-standard path (for example ``/opt/nginx/``) you can point to the path of the NGINX binary with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ NGINX_PATH=/opt/nginx/sbin make serve

NGINX will be started on port 8080 so you can view the wiki by browsing to http://localhost:8080/

When you are done, **CTRL-C** will exit NGINX.
